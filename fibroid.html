        <div class="lead"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fibroids are the most frequently seen tumors of the female reproductive system. Fibroids, also known as uterine myomas, leiomyomas, or fibromas, are firm, compact tumors that are made of smooth muscle cells and fibrous connective tissue that develop in the uterus. It is estimated that between 20 to 50 percent of women of reproductive age have Fibroids. Some estimates state that up to 30 to 77 percent of women will develop Fibroids sometime during their childbearing years.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fibroid has become rampant in the Nigerian society due to modern lifestyle. The causes of Fibroid can be traced to the type of lifestyle that we now live. The lifestyle we now live cannot be compared with the natural lifestyles of the people of old. There are so many things that are bringing in a lot of estrogen (hormone influencing the growth of Fibroids) into the body systems now, like plastics, pesticides and even the foods and the processes under which we breed animals for consumption. Most of these things, including fishes, are bred artificially. So they store those hormones that we are imbibing and that is what is causing Fibroids problems.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fibroids tumors develops from an aberrant muscle cell in the uterus, which multiplies rapidly because of the influence of estrogen. Women who are approaching menopause are at the greatest risk for Fibroids because of their long exposure to high levels of estrogen.</p></div>

Nigeria have Fibroid between the age of 30-50 years and more so, some ladies below 30 years of age who are single and have no children are getting to develop this tumor in their body already.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>IS ANY OF THESE COMMON TO YOU?</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fallopian Anemia (as a result of heavy menstrual periods)

                        <p class="card-text">"My name is Obafemi Folasade, before I came in contact with this products, I had been diagnosed with fibroids/ovarian cyst on 19th of June, 2013. It was a terrible experience for me because I had to visit hospital twice a week for treatment. I went through several tests and also minor operation procedures. The doctor even took some tissues from my womb lining for more tests. I was bleeding twice monthly with severe pains and I had to wear diapers because whenever I was bleeding I usually experienced paralysis from my waist to my leg. I have bled for a month non-stop before.
<br>As time went on, I was scheduled for a major surgery on 24th of May 2014. I could no longer wear white which is my best colour because of my excessive bleeding, I started wearing dark colours. This went on for 2 years till I met a friend who recommended these products to me.
<br>Lo and behold I started having a normal pain free periods after taking the health supplements which eventually help me to push out the fibroids. I have gone for several tests and scan since that and the doctors could not find the fibroid/cyst. I have been touched by these amazing products".</p>

Now you can join the successful 7% group that keeps it off forever. Conventional treatments such as birth control drugs, anti-inflammatory drugs, and surgery mostly address the symptoms of Fibroid and work short-term.
