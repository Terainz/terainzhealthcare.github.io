        <h3 class="mbr-section-title display-2">Let's Talk About Diabetes</h3>
        <div class="lead"><p><strong>Diabetes</strong>, often referred to by doctors as <em>Diabetes mellitus</em>, describes a group of metabolic diseases in which the person has high blood glucose (blood sugar) either because insulin production is inadequate, or because the body's cells do not respond properly to insulin, or both.
</p><p>People with diabetes either do not produce enough insulin, a hormone that is needed to convert sugar, starches, and other food into energy needed for daily life, or cannot use the insulin that their bodies produce. As a result, glucose builds up in the bloodstream.
</p><p><strong>Why is it called diabetes mellitus?</strong></p><p>Diabetes comes from Greek, and it means a "siphon". Aretus the Cappadocian, a Greek physician during the second century A.D. named the condition diabainein. He described patients who were passing too much water (polyuria) - like a siphon. The word became "diabetes" from the English adoption of the Medieval Latin diabetes.</p><p>In 1675, Thomas Willis added mellitus to the term, although it is commonly referred to simply as diabetes. Mel in Latin means "honey"; the urine and blood of people with diabetes has excess glucose, and glucose is sweet like honey. Diabetes mellitus could literally mean "siphoning off sweet water".</p><p> In ancient China people observed that ants would be attracted to some people's urine, because it was sweet. The term "Sweet Urine Disease" was coined.</p><p><strong>Types of Diabetes</strong>
</p><p><strong>1.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>	Type 1 Diabetes:</strong>&nbsp;Also known as juvenile or insulin dependent diabetes, type 1 diabetes occurs when the cells of the pancreas that are responsible for producing insulin are destroyed by the immune system. As a result, the pancreas permanently loses its ability to produce enough insulin to regulate blood sugar levels appropriately
</p><p><strong>2.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>	Type 2 Diabetes:</strong>&nbsp;This form of the disease makes up 90% or more of all cases of diabetes. It usually develops in adulthood. It occurs when the pancreas cannot make enough insulin to keep blood glucose levels normal and is made worse by poor food choices, a sedentary lifestyle, and being overweight. Diabetes is a serious condition, but many people with type 2 diabetes do not know they have it.
</p><p><strong>3.	</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Gestational diabetes:
&nbsp;</strong>This type affects females during pregnancy. Some women have very high levels of glucose in their blood, and their bodies are unable to produce enough insulin to transport all of the glucose into their cells, resulting in progressively rising levels of glucose.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Type 1 Diabetes:</strong></p><p>Type 1 diabetes can occur at any age, but usually starts in people younger than 30 years of age. Symptoms are usually severe and occur rapidly. They include:
</p><p><strong>•</strong>	Increased thirst&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>•</strong>	Increased urination&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>•</strong>	Weight loss despite increased appetite&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>•</strong>	Nausea</p><p><strong>•</strong>	Vomiting&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>•</strong>	Abdominal pain&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>•</strong>	Fatigue&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>•</strong>	Absence of menstruation</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Type 2 Diabetes:</strong> </p><p>People with type 2 diabetes often have no symptoms, and their condition is detected only when a routine exam reveals high levels of glucose in their blood. Occasionally, however, a person with type 2 diabetes may experience symptoms listed below, which tend to appear slowly over time:
</p><p><strong>•</strong>	Numbness or burning sensation of the feet, ankles, and legs
</p><p><strong>•</strong>	Blurred or poor vision
</p><p><strong>•</strong>	Impotence
</p><p><strong>•</strong>	Fatigue
</p><p><strong>•</strong>	Poor wound healing
</p><p><strong>In some cases, symptoms may mimic type 1 diabetes and appear more abruptly, such as:
</strong></p><p><strong>•</strong>	Excessive urination and thirst
</p><p><strong>•</strong>	Yeast infections
</p><p><strong>•</strong>	Whole body itching
</p><p><strong>•</strong>	Coma: In severe cases, high blood glucose may affect water distribution in brain cells, causing a state of deep unconsciousness, or coma.</p></div>

        <h3 class="mbr-section-title display-2">Causes And Risk Factors Of Diebetes</h3>
        <div class="lead"><p><strong>CAUSES</strong></p><p><strong>•</strong>	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both type 1 and type 2 diabetes are caused by the <strong>absence, insufficient production, or lack of response by cells in the body to the hormone insulin</strong>. Insulin is a key regulator of the body's metabolism. After meals, food is digested in the stomach and intestines. Sugar (glucose) molecules are absorbed directly into the bloodstream, and blood glucose levels rise. Under normal circumstances, the rise in blood glucose levels signals specific cells in the pancreas, called beta cells, to secrete insulin into the bloodstream. Insulin, in turn, enables glucose to enter cells in the body that may be burned for energy or stored for future use.
</p><p><strong>•</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	In <strong>type 1 diabetes</strong>, the beta cells of the pancreas produce little or no insulin, the hormone that allows glucose to enter body cells. Once glucose enters a cell, it is used as fuel. Without adequate insulin, glucose builds up in the bloodstream instead of going into the cells. The body is unable to use this glucose for energy despite high levels in the bloodstream, leading to increased hunger.
</p><p><strong>•</strong>	In addition, the high levels of glucose in the blood cause the patient to urinate more, which leads to excessive thirst. Within 5 to 10 years after diagnosis, the insulin-producing beta cells of the pancreas are completely destroyed, and no more insulin is produced.
</p><p><strong>•</strong>	The exact cause of type 1 diabetes is not known. Each year more than 13,000 young people are diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. New cases are less common among adults older than 20.
</p><p><strong>•</strong>	<strong>Type 2 diabetes</strong> usually develops in older, overweight individuals who become resistant to the effects of insulin over time. When type 2 diabetes is diagnosed, the pancreas is usually producing enough insulin but, for unknown reasons, the body cannot use the insulin effectively. This is called insulin resistance. This means that the insulin produced by your pancreas cannot connect with fat and muscle cells to let glucose inside and produce energy. This causes hyperglycemia (high blood glucose). To compensate, the pancreas produces more insulin. The cells sense this flood of insulin and become even more resistant, resulting in a vicious cycle of high glucose levels and often high insulin levels.
</p><p><strong>•</strong>	Inflammation is also common among those with type 2 diabetes. Inflammatory markers (chemicals in the body that lead to inflammation), such as interleukin-6 (Il-6) and C-reactive protein, have been found to be increased in those with type 2 diabetes.
</p><p><strong>•</strong>	Type 2 diabetes usually occurs gradually. Most people with type 2 diabetes are overweight at the time of diagnosis. However, the disease can also develop in lean people, especially the elderly.
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>RISK FACTORS</strong></p><p><strong>Type 1 diabetes
</strong></p><p><strong>•</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Family history of type 1 diabetes
</p><p><strong>•</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Mother who had pre-eclampsia (a condition characterized by a sharp increase in blood pressure during the third trimester of pregnancy)
</p><p><strong>•</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Family history of autoimmune diseases, including Hashimoto's thyroiditis, Graves disease, myasthenia gravis, Addison disease, or pernicious anemia
</p><p><strong>•</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Viral infections during infancy, including mumps, rubella, and coxsackie
</p><p><strong>•</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Child of an older mother
</p><p><strong>•</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Northern European or Mediterranean descent
</p><p><strong>•</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Lack of breastfeeding and consumption of cow's milk during infancy (although the theory is controversial and not widely accepted)
</p><p><strong>Type 2 diabetes
</strong></p><p><strong>•</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Family history of type 2 diabetes (one quarter to one third of all individuals with type 2 diabetes have a family history of the condition)
</p><p><strong>•</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Age older than 45 years
</p><p><strong>•</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Excess body fat, particularly around the waist
</p><p><strong>•</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Sedentary lifestyle and high-fat, high-calorie diet
</p><p><strong>•</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Abnormal levels of cholesterol or triglycerides in the blood
</p><p><strong>•</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	High blood pressure
</p><p><strong>•</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	History of gestational diabetes or polycystic ovarian syndrome (a hormonal disorder that causes women to have irregular or no menstruation)
</p><p><strong>•</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	African American, Hispanic American, or Native American (particularly Pima tribe in Arizona) descent
</p><p><strong>•</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Low birth weight or a mother's malnutrition in pregnancy (this may cause metabolic disturbances in a fetus that lead to diabetes later in the child's life)
</p><p><strong>•</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Depression is associated with a 60% increased risk of type 2 diabetes</p></div>

        <div class="lead"><p><strong>Complications linked to badly controlled diabetes:
</strong></p><p><strong>Below is a list of possible complications that can be caused by badly controlled diabetes:
</strong></p><p><strong></strong>	<strong>Eye complications -</strong> glaucoma, cataracts, diabetic retinopathy, and some others.
</p><p><strong>	Foot complications - </strong>neuropathy, ulcers, and sometimes gangrene which may require that the foot be amputated
</p><p><strong>	Skin complications </strong>- people with diabetes are more susceptible to skin infections and skin disorders
</p><p><strong>	Heart problems -</strong> such as ischemic heart disease, when the blood supply to the heart muscle is diminished
</p><p><strong>	Hypertension - </strong>common in people with diabetes, which can raise the risk of kidney disease, eye problems, heart attack and stroke
</p><p><strong>	Mental health -</strong> uncontrolled diabetes raises the risk of suffering from depression, anxiety and some other mental disorders
</p><p><strong>	Hearing loss -</strong> diabetes patients have a higher risk of developing hearing problems
</p><p><strong>	Gum disease -</strong> there is a much higher prevalence of gum disease among diabetes patients
</p><p><strong>	Gastroparesis -</strong> the muscles of the stomach stop working properly
</p><p><strong>	Ketoacidosis -</strong> a combination of ketosis and acidosis; accumulation of ketone bodies and acidity in the blood.
</p><p><strong>	Neuropathy -</strong> diabetic neuropathy is a type of nerve damage which can lead to several different problems.
</p><p><strong>	HHNS (Hyperosmolar Hyperglycemic Nonketotic Syndrome) -</strong> blood glucose levels shoot up too high, and there are no ketones present in the blood or urine. It is an emergency condition.
</p><p><strong>	Nephropathy -</strong> uncontrolled blood pressure can lead to kidney disease
</p><p><strong>	PAD (peripheral arterial disease) -</strong> symptoms may include pain in the leg, tingling and sometimes problems walking properly
</p><p><strong>	Stroke -</strong> if blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and blood glucose levels are not controlled, the risk of stroke increases significantly
</p><p><strong>	Erectile dysfunction -</strong> male impotence.
</p><p><strong>	Infections -</strong> people with badly controlled diabetes are much more susceptible to infections
</p><p><strong>	Healing of wounds -</strong> cuts and lesions take much longer to heal
